**About Us**

Welcome to YawPitchRoll.

Founded by [Neha Agarwal](https://www.linkedin.com/in/nagarwa/) and [Nikhil Soni](www.linkedin.com/in/soninikhil), YawPitchRoll emerged from a rich tapestry of expertise and passion.

At the heart of YawPitchRoll is a philosophy rooted in simplicity, elegance, and functionality. In a world often chasing the illusion of perfection, we choose to prioritize the good. To us, it's not about reaching an elusive end, but rather about the journey of continuous improvement. Iteration and experimentation aren't just strategies; they are the very essence of our ethos.

We're here to simplify, beautify, and make functionality the cornerstone of your data-driven needs. Because for us, it's always about being simple, elegant, and purposefully functional.
